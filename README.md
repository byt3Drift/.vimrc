This is a public repository of my own .vimrc config file.
It is free to use for anyone. 

The config file will expand alongside my expirience using vim. As for now (24.12.2025) i am using vim for a few days.
I did already made some basic configurations.

For every configuration i will add a short description of what it does. The comments will probably be mostly usefull for beginners in Vim and coding like myself.

Feel free to add your own tweaks to the config file or use my config, altough its the most optimal if you edit and tweak mine to your own user expirence.
